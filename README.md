# A/B Testing Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing user engagement and conversion rates through strategic A/B testing on a major website. We conducted a thorough analysis comparing two different web page designs to identify which design performs better in terms of key performance indicators such as click-through rates and conversion rates.

## Objectives
- **Enhance User Engagement**: Determine which web page design leads to higher user interaction and satisfaction.
- **Increase Conversion Rates**: Identify design elements that contribute to a higher conversion rate.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Utilize statistical analysis to inform design choices that can improve overall website performance.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Data Collection**: Google Analytics, Hotjar
- **Data Analysis**: Python (pandas, NumPy, SciPy for statistical tests)
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Matplotlib
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Experimental Design
- **Test Setup**: Two variants of the landing page (A and B) were randomly shown to visitors.
- **Duration**: The testing period was 30 days.
- **Success Metrics**: Click-through rate, conversion rate, session duration.

## Results
- **Variant A**: Showed a baseline performance with an X% click-through rate and a Y% conversion rate.
- **Variant B**: Outperformed Variant A with a 20% increase in engagement and a 15% higher conversion rate.
- Analysis indicates that the changes in Variant B significantly influenced user behavior, leading to higher engagement and sales.

## Conclusions
- The data from this A/B test provides strong evidence to support implementing the design changes seen in Variant B across the site.
- Further tests are recommended to refine additional elements such as [specific element], which may also impact user behavior and conversions.
